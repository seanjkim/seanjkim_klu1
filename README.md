# Robocode Writeup
We wanted to talk about 4 things about our robocode project for our class CS141:
1. How we felt about the project
2. What we learned
3. Did we achieve what we wanted
4. How to improve

Robocode was an overall unique experience from the basic programming we have been doing for the first few quarters of computer science. What made robocode a different experience from past programming assignments was the longevity of the project, problem solving with other colleagues, and meeting weekly deadlines.

Working with a given API instead of code we were already familiar with gave us a look into what programming would take form of more in the future. Rather than given a simple assignment to work on alone and then proceed to the next assignment, it exercised our collaborative and creative problem solving skill set which was new and enjoyable. Robocode gave insight in what it is like to work with other people’s work and how to apply it to your own. If we had looked more thoroughly through the API and spent more time researching functions we wanted, our robot could have been in a better spot at the 10th week. 

We did not achieve what we wanted, which was to design a robot that could consistently avoid walls, have smooth moving patterns, and dodge incoming bullets. Instead we achieved only halfway of all three of those goals. It avoided walls but bugged near corners, would stop itself in order to shoot, and would independently move to dodge bullets rather than taking into account where enemy bullets would be coming from. We also failed to remember that the tournament battles would have multiple robots instead of just ours and another’s. (1v1)

If we were to continue working on our MoltenCoreBot, we would have to smooth out its moving functions, design an entirely new avoidBullets algorithm, and implement a playstyle that incorporates combating against multiple robots instead of just one other.
